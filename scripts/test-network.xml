<!--
  Test network for testing k8s setup
  - Different subnet: 10.99.16.0/24 (won't conflict with 192.168.16.0/24)
  - NAT mode (VMs can reach host, host can reach VMs)
  - DHCP for initial FCOS boot (guest uses eth0 directly)
  - After bootc switch: guest creates VLAN 2 interface using 8021q module
  - Bridge is configured as VLAN-aware after bootc switch (see test-vm.sh)
  - Host uses untagged traffic, guest uses VLAN 2 tagged traffic
  - Host gets 10.99.16.1 on bridge for access
